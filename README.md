Console Cabby
=============
_Copyright (C) 2017 Jim Saunders_
 
A simple terminal based game where you drive around and pick up fares to collect money before time runs out. This game was 
written in C++ and uses the great [rlutil](https://github.com/tapio/rlutil/) library as well as a few common C/C++ libs.

The only true dependency is rlutil which comes with the code so you shouldn't need to install anything to get it compiled 
and running.

## COMPILE ##
To compile console cabby use the supplied make file then run the `cabby` binary.

```
